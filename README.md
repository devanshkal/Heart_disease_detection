This repository presents a deep learning-based approach for detecting heart disease using structured clinical data. Two models are implemented and compared: a standard Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) and an FNN enhanced with an Attention Mechanism to improve feature interpretation and model performance.

🧠 Models Used:
Feedforward Neural Network (FNN): A fully connected neural architecture for baseline prediction.

FNN + Attention: Integrates an attention layer to assign dynamic weights to features, enhancing decision-making by focusing on the most relevant clinical inputs.

📊 Features:
Clean and preprocessed heart disease dataset

Model architecture and training pipelines in PyTorch/TensorFlow (or specify your framework)

Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC

Attention heatmaps for interpretability

Modular and reusable code

🏥 Application:
This project demonstrates the potential of attention-based neural networks in identifying patterns and important clinical indicators for early detection of heart disease, aiding medical professionals in diagnosis and decision support.
